# Eat Da Burger App
## Overview

In this assignment, you'll create a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Be sure to follow the MVC design pattern; use Node and MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.

## Instruction

* Pick one of the burger to devour it.
* Type in whatever burger you want to order in the white box. Then click Submit.
* Your burger will now be displayed above the box to be devoured. 
* You can enter as much burgers as you want.
